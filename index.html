            Origin Hotel began with a basic premise: a hotel is a reflection of its company culture. So we set out to be the most dynamic hotel we could be. Turns out it’s easier (and more fun) to think that way.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are explorers and experience-junkies. We like to dine, to connect, to discover, and yes, to travel. Our passion for the local culture is real and our places are meant to be shared. We pick fantastic locations and we obsess over design. We don’t stop until our properties have an individual spirit and are an environment for guest and employee connection—a truly shared space.
          </p>
          <p class="right">
            Ask us anything. We’ll answer from personal experiences—not search-engines. We share places we love—no matter the rating.  We want to inspire, and be inspired by you. We are not a demographic, an age bracket, a look. We are people seeking unique experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s a lifestyle we all share, and will continue to share every day. So be quirky. Be honest. Be vibrant. Be adventurous. Our Origin Hotel community welcomes you to be yourself—whoever that is.
